# Afro-Arabian biogeography
Here there are scripts and data for the project on the biogeography of Afro-Arabia squamates. 
With Austin H. Patton, Luke J. Harmon, Daniel S. Caetano, Jiri Smid and Salvador Carranza.

Folders: 
- data: phylogenetic and distributional data for Afro-Arabian squamates.
- locations: location files with biogeographic states for each genus.
- objects: R objects produced during the analyses and used for specific tasks (e.g., figure production).
- Rscripts: scripts for biogeographic analyses and data visualization.
- functions: additional R functions to be loaded in order to run the scripts.
